0. Transfer a file to your server
Write a Bash script that transfers a file from our client to a server

1. Install nginx web server
Web servers are the piece of software generating and serving HTML pages, let’s install one!

2. Setup a domain name

3. Redirection
Configure your Nginx server so that /redirect_me is redirecting to another page

4. Not found page 404
Configure your Nginx server to have a custom 404 page that contains the string Ceci n'est pas une page

5. Install Nginx web server (w/ Puppet)
we’d like you to install and configure an Nginx server using Puppet instead of Bash. To save time and effort, you should also include resources in your manifest to perform a 301 redirect when querying /redirect_me.
